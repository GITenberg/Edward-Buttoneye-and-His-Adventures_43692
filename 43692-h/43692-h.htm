<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">And, though he never could explain,</div>
<div class="verse02">I don&rsquo;t mind telling you</div>
<div class="verse00">That in that box he had been lain</div>
<div class="verse00">By those who made him, limb and brain,</div>
<div class="verse02">And stitched his eyes on, too.</div>
<div class="verse00">It&rsquo;s odd, you&rsquo;ll think, they joined his toes</div>
<div class="verse00">And gave him such a head and nose.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">But there on the broad countryside</div>
<div class="verse02">Was he, a homeless lad.</div>
<div class="verse00">Another might have sat and cried,</div>
<div class="verse00">But Edward, no. &ldquo;Whate&rsquo;er betide,</div>
<div class="verse02">If work is to be had,</div>
<div class="verse00">I&rsquo;ll take,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;what Fortune brings</div>
<div class="verse00">And live in hopes of better things.&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">A farmhouse stood not far away,</div>
<div class="verse02">So first there Edward tried,</div>
<div class="verse00">And was engaged to herd by day</div>
<div class="verse00">And night the farmer&rsquo;s sheep, which stray,</div>
<div class="verse02">Whene&rsquo;er they can, and hide.</div>
<div class="verse00">And so a paper Edward bought</div>
<div class="verse00">And sat and watched and read and thought.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">He read through each advertisement</div>
<div class="verse02">To see if he could find</div>
<div class="verse00">A place he thought would suit his bent,</div>
<div class="verse00">In which he could be quite content</div>
<div class="verse02">And cultivate his mind.</div>
<div class="verse00">&mdash;He read so hard and thought so deep</div>
<div class="verse00">He quite forgot about the sheep.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">But when at last he looked around,</div>
<div class="verse02">His flock could not be seen.</div>
<div class="verse00">He shouted, called, and searched the ground,</div>
<div class="verse00">The sheep were nowhere to be found</div>
<div class="verse02">(They knew that he was green);</div>
<div class="verse00">And when in fear he ventured back,</div>
<div class="verse00">I scarce need say he got the sack.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">He went away with many sighs</div>
<div class="verse02">And sight a little dim,</div>
<div class="verse00">But suddenly, to his surprise,</div>
<div class="verse00">A woolly head with shining eyes</div>
<div class="verse02">Peered through the hedge at him.</div>
<div class="verse00">&ldquo;If you will let me come with you,&rdquo;</div>
<div class="verse00">It said, &ldquo;I always will be true.&rdquo;</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Our Edward with delight agreed;</div>
<div class="verse02">&ldquo;It looks,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;quite tame;</div>
<div class="verse00">A counsellor and friend I need,</div>
<div class="verse00">Besides, it may serve as a steed.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="verse02">And so he asked its name.</div>
<div class="verse00">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Horace, so they all allege,&rdquo;</div>
<div class="verse00">It said, and scrambled through the hedge.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i012.jpg" width="400" height="392" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">So side by side, o&rsquo;er hill and dale,</div>
<div class="verse02">The gallant heroes strode,</div>
<div class="verse00">And Horace frisked his stumpy tail</div>
<div class="verse00">And joked with every frog and snail</div>
<div class="verse02">And chaffed each slug and toad.</div>
<div class="verse00">But silent Edward longed for fame</div>
<div class="verse00">And by great deeds to make a name.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">He also wished he had a hat</div>
<div class="verse02">&mdash;The day was very warm&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse00">But soon he ceased to think of that,</div>
<div class="verse00">For lo! beside the road there sat</div>
<div class="verse02">Two maids of sweetest charm.</div>
<div class="verse00">&rsquo;Twas saucy Sue and modest Moll,</div>
<div class="verse00">Who sported a red parasol.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Then Edward&rsquo;s heart beat high with pride,</div>
<div class="verse02">He drew himself erect</div>
<div class="verse00">And said to Horace, &ldquo;Quick, now! stride</div>
<div class="verse00">As if you wore Newfoundland hide</div>
<div class="verse02">And follow with respect.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="verse00">But, &rsquo;spite of all their dashing air,</div>
<div class="verse00">The maids preserved their glassy stare.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i014.jpg" width="400" height="389" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">A flush o&rsquo;erspread poor Edward&rsquo;s cheek,</div>
<div class="verse02">He walked on very fast,</div>
<div class="verse00">And Horace followed, very meek.</div>
<div class="verse00">But all at once they heard a shriek</div>
<div class="verse02">From the fair dames they&rsquo;d passed:</div>
<div class="verse00">&mdash;Enraged to see their sunshade red,</div>
<div class="verse00">A wild bull charged with lowered head.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">&ldquo;Ah, here&rsquo;s my chance,&rdquo; brave Edward cried,</div>
<div class="verse02">And, counting not the cost,</div>
<div class="verse00">He rushed back to the maidens&rsquo; side;</div>
<div class="verse00">To stop the bull he vainly tried</div>
<div class="verse02">And was most painfully tossed.</div>
<div class="verse00">&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;no luck to-day;</div>
<div class="verse00">&mdash;But <i>they</i>, at least, have got away.&rdquo;</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i016.jpg" width="400" height="388" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Sad Horace hastened to the spot</div>
<div class="verse02">And rendered him first aid,</div>
<div class="verse00">Then set off at his quickest trot</div>
<div class="verse00">For help. Poor Edward groaned a lot:</div>
<div class="verse02">&ldquo;Why was I ever made?&rdquo;</div>
<div class="verse00">&mdash;I&rsquo;m not surprised he had the hump,</div>
<div class="verse00">He came down such an awful bump.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">And as he sat, there passed him by</div>
<div class="verse02">Two visions of delight;</div>
<div class="verse00">Each viewed with fond, maternal eye</div>
<div class="verse00">And hugged&mdash;it made poor Edward sigh&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse02">A golliwoggy fright.</div>
<div class="verse00">He tried to cry to them out loud,</div>
<div class="verse00">But nothing came&mdash;he felt too proud.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i019.jpg" width="399" height="390" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">They walked straight past and soon were gone,</div>
<div class="verse02">Poor Edward could have cried.</div>
<div class="verse00">He knew that he belonged to one,</div>
<div class="verse00">That he would one day be her son,</div>
<div class="verse02">But he was dumb from pride.</div>
<div class="verse00">He felt that of the two he&rsquo;d choose</div>
<div class="verse00">The one with soft red hair and shoes.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" width="399" height="390" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">But Horace soon returned and said</div>
<div class="verse02">He nowhere help could find;</div>
<div class="verse00">So Edward mounted him instead</div>
<div class="verse00">And held on by his charger&rsquo;s head.</div>
<div class="verse02">(Now wasn&rsquo;t Horace kind?)</div>
<div class="verse00">They travelled thus o&rsquo;er hill and plain</div>
<div class="verse00">Till Edward was quite well again.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">To get a place where he could thrive</div>
<div class="verse02">Our Edward found was hard,</div>
<div class="verse00">But soon he was engaged to drive</div>
<div class="verse00">A railway train, and did contrive</div>
<div class="verse02">That Horace should be guard.</div>
<div class="verse00">One day he saw what made him quail</div>
<div class="verse00">&mdash;A sleepy tortoise on the rail!</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i025.jpg" width="399" height="389" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">He found he hadn&rsquo;t time to stop,</div>
<div class="verse02">Though manfully he tried,</div>
<div class="verse00">So biff! and crash! and up and flop!</div>
<div class="verse00">They went. The tortoise did not hop</div>
<div class="verse02">But went on, sleepy-eyed.</div>
<div class="verse00">Poor Edward knew what was in store,</div>
<div class="verse00">&mdash;Of course he got the sack once more.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i027.jpg" width="398" height="389" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">The next employment Edward found</div>
<div class="verse02">Was towing someone&rsquo;s barge.</div>
<div class="verse00">Their cargo weighed full many a pound,</div>
<div class="verse00">And as beside the stream they wound</div>
<div class="verse02">Their burden felt so large</div>
<div class="verse00">That Horace, every hour or so,</div>
<div class="verse00">Said, &ldquo;Are you sure coal doesn&rsquo;t grow?&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">But onward still brave Edward strode</div>
<div class="verse02">And onward trudged his steed;</div>
<div class="verse00">Though leaden grew their lumpy load</div>
<div class="verse00">No signs of giving in they showed</div>
<div class="verse02">Till, all at once, a reed</div>
<div class="verse00">Upset the barge, the cargo sank</div>
<div class="verse00">And left them workless on the bank.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i029.jpg" width="400" height="302" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Soon after that they came across</div>
<div class="verse02">Some races in full swing.</div>
<div class="verse00">Said Edward, &ldquo;Horses cannot toss</div>
<div class="verse00">And you can serve me as a hoss,</div>
<div class="verse02">&mdash;&rsquo;Twill be the very thing.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="verse00">So Horace summoned all his strength</div>
<div class="verse00">And came in first by half a length.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i030.jpg" width="400" height="293" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">But Horace felt so very done</div>
<div class="verse02">And very short of breath</div>
<div class="verse00">(You see, he was not built to run</div>
<div class="verse00">So fast), he gasped that even one</div>
<div class="verse02">More race would be his death.</div>
<div class="verse00">So Edward mournfully supposed</div>
<div class="verse00">A jockey&rsquo;s life to him was closed.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">To give good Horace perfect rest</div>
<div class="verse02">They lay awhile at ease.</div>
<div class="verse00">They found a hammock suited best,</div>
<div class="verse00">Exchanging quip and merry jest</div>
<div class="verse02">With frogs and bumble-bees,</div>
<div class="verse00">And Edward helped stray leaves and twigs</div>
<div class="verse00">Along the stream with gentle digs.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">When Horace was quite well again</div>
<div class="verse02">They set out on their way.</div>
<div class="verse00">One day they heard a distant strain</div>
<div class="verse00">And, tramping o&rsquo;er the dusty plain</div>
<div class="verse02">With music loud and gay,</div>
<div class="verse00">A brawny-chested regiment</div>
<div class="verse00">Marched past, on death or glory bent.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">The sight so fired brave Edward&rsquo;s soul,</div>
<div class="verse02">He set off in the rear.</div>
<div class="verse00">Said he, &ldquo;The cavalry&rsquo;s our goal,</div>
<div class="verse00">&mdash;A charger is your proper r&ocirc;le;&rdquo;</div>
<div class="verse02">But Horace shook with fear.</div>
<div class="verse00">&ldquo;If we,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;the foe should seek,</div>
<div class="verse00">I shall be mutton in a week!&rdquo;</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">But when they reached the barrack-yard</div>
<div class="verse02">And wanted to enlist,</div>
<div class="verse00">The sergeant called out to the guard</div>
<div class="verse00">Their measurements, punched Edward hard</div>
<div class="verse02">And gave his neck a twist.</div>
<div class="verse00">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got no chest at all,&rdquo; said he.</div>
<div class="verse00">&ldquo;No good!&rdquo; thought Edward tearfully.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault I&rsquo;ve got no chest,</div>
<div class="verse02">They should have made it broad,&rdquo;</div>
<div class="verse00">He grumbled; but with noble zest</div>
<div class="verse00">He searched the country east and west</div>
<div class="verse02">To find some noble lord</div>
<div class="verse00">Who might excuse his tender age</div>
<div class="verse00">And take him on to be his page.</div>

<div class="verse02">Was such that on all fours</div>

<div class="verse00">And watched with quite an envious thrill</div>
<div class="verse00">Two boys who handled with great skill</div>
<div class="verse02">A trim, fast-sailing yacht.</div>
<div class="verse00">&ldquo;O for an opportunity,&rdquo;</div>
<div class="verse00">Sighed Edward, &ldquo;to put out to sea!&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">The chance they wanted soon occurred</div>
<div class="verse02">&mdash;The boys went in to tea.</div>
<div class="verse00">By thoughts of danger undeterred</div>
<div class="verse00">They boarded, tacked and, in a word,</div>
<div class="verse02">Were happy as could be.</div>
<div class="verse00">They did not see the rising cloud</div>
<div class="verse00">That threatened every spar and shroud.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">With all their sails set to the breeze,</div>
<div class="verse02">They were quite unprepared</div>
<div class="verse00">To meet the squall. Great tow&rsquo;ring seas</div>
<div class="verse00">Tossed them about like shipwrecked peas;</div>
<div class="verse02">They would most ill have fared</div>
<div class="verse00">Had not a tortoise saved the twain</div>
<div class="verse00">&mdash;He who derailed the railway train.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">He took them on his brawny back</div>
<div class="verse02">And swam with them ashore.</div>
<div class="verse00">&ldquo;This slight return I owe for lack</div>
<div class="verse00">Of thought,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when o&rsquo;er the track</div>
<div class="verse02">I crawled;&mdash;I&rsquo;d do much more,</div>
<div class="verse00">But this, at least, will prove to you</div>
<div class="verse00">How much that sad event I rue.&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">They thanked him for his kindly deed</div>
<div class="verse02">And then resumed their march,</div>
<div class="verse00">But when the time was come to feed</div>
<div class="verse00">They found they&rsquo;d nought to meet the need</div>
<div class="verse02">Except a piece of starch.</div>
<div class="verse00">Said Edward, &ldquo;This will never do;</div>
<div class="verse00">Your wool, old chap, would be like glue.&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">They had no work, they had no food,</div>
<div class="verse02">But hungrier they grew.</div>
<div class="verse00">At last said Horace, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good</div>
<div class="verse00">Of starving slowly? In the wood</div>
<div class="verse02">There&rsquo;s game enough for two.</div>
<div class="verse00">I feel quite faint, so get a gun</div>
<div class="verse00">And see what you can shoot, my son.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">This was for Edward the last straw,</div>
<div class="verse02">And so he took a gun;</div>
<div class="verse00">For Horace he would brave the law,</div>
<div class="verse00">Whate&rsquo;er betide. So when he saw</div>
<div class="verse02">A hare start up and run,</div>
<div class="verse00">He took fair aim with steady wrist</div>
<div class="verse00">And fired&mdash;but luckily he missed.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">A policeman heard the loud report</div>
<div class="verse02">And hurried to the scene.</div>
<div class="verse00">He hailed the poachers off to court,</div>
<div class="verse00">And there their shrift was very short</div>
<div class="verse02">&mdash;The judge&rsquo;s wit was keen:</div>
<div class="verse00">He sentenced them to prison-shop</div>
<div class="verse00">And hoped that long in there they&rsquo;d stop.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Now prison-shop, of course, is where</div>
<div class="verse02">All dolls, when made, must go</div>
<div class="verse00">Until some maiden, kind and fair,</div>
<div class="verse00">Buys them and saves them from despair.</div>

<div class="verse00">So Edward was marched off to jail</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Cold beads of perspiration stood</div>
<div class="verse02">On Edward&rsquo;s frantic brow;</div>
<div class="verse00">He feared lest his own mother should</div>
<div class="verse00">Not notice him (as if she could</div>
<div class="verse02">Have missed her own son, now!).</div>
<div class="verse00">But, scarcely glancing at the rest,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">&ldquo;O what a pleasant person, look!&rdquo;</div>
<div class="verse02">She cried to Hildebrand,</div>
<div class="verse00">&ldquo;I must have him by hook or crook!&rdquo;</div>
<div class="verse00">&mdash;In point of fact &rsquo;twas by a hook</div>
<div class="verse02">Held in the shopman&rsquo;s hand,</div>
<div class="verse00">Which hoisted Edward by the seat,</div>
<div class="verse00">A part adapted for the feat.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Now Pen had put her pennies by</div>
<div class="verse02">To save poor dolls from fate</div>
<div class="verse00">By buying them, and you should try</div>
<div class="verse00">To do the same. The Buttoneye</div>
<div class="verse02">Was marked, &ldquo;Price two and eight.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="verse00">&rsquo;Twas dear, but Pen was quite content</div>
<div class="verse00">To think her savings so well spent.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">The ransom very soon was paid</div>
<div class="verse02">And Edward, once more free,</div>
<div class="verse00">Borne off in triumph. Though arrayed</div>
<div class="verse00">In shabby coat and trousers frayed</div>
<div class="verse02">And baggy at the knee,</div>
<div class="verse00">He was more precious to Pen&rsquo;s heart</div>
<div class="verse00">Than if they&rsquo;d been quite new and smart.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">And faithful Horace, too, was bought</div>
<div class="verse02">&mdash;Pen saw by Edward&rsquo;s eye</div>
<div class="verse00">No freedom for himself he sought</div>
<div class="verse00">If his pet lamb&rsquo;s fate should be fraught</div>
<div class="verse02">With doubt&mdash;he&rsquo;d rather die.</div>
<div class="verse00">But Horace had to run like mad,</div>
<div class="verse00">So fast a pace his mistress had.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d go through twice as much for this,&rdquo;</div>
<div class="verse02">Thought Edward with a sigh</div>
<div class="verse00">As he received his hundredth kiss,</div>
<div class="verse00">And Horace, wrapped in wool and bliss,</div>
<div class="verse02">Just winked the other eye.</div>
<div class="verse00">And how they relished, to be sure,</div>
<div class="verse00">The other dolls&rsquo; discomfiture!</div>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

<p>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

<p>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
